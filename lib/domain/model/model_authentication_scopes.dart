// Requested scopes, as a comma delimited string, e.g. "activity:read_all,activity:write". Applications should request only the scopes required for the application to function normally. The scope activity:read is required for activity webhooks.
//
// read: read public segments, public routes, public profile data, public posts, public events, club feeds, and leaderboards
// read_all:read private routes, private segments, and private events for the user
// profile:read_all: read all profile information even if the user has set their profile visibility to Followers or Only You
// profile:write: update the user's weight and Functional Threshold Power (FTP), and access to star or unstar segments on their behalf
// activity:read: read the user's activity data for activities that are visible to Everyone and Followers, excluding privacy zone data
// activity:read_all: the same access as activity:read, plus privacy zone data and access to read the user's activities with visibility set to Only You
// activity:write: access to create manual activities and uploads, and access to edit any activities that are visible to the app, based on activity read access level
